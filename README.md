A challenge given to me as part of the Human Care Systems interview process.
To see requirements, see SQE_Engineer_Challenge.docx in the repository.

To setup and run this repository, you need NodeJS, npm, and a mongoDB localhost.

Once you've cloned and moved into the repository, use the command *npm i* to install all of the required packages.
Then, you can use *npm run setup* to run a script that creates the collection and populates the tables.
After that, *npm test* to run the tests and see the results in your console.
